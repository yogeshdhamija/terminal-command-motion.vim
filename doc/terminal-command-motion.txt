                                            *acm* *icm*
`terminal-command-motion.vim` will add a new motion that can be used in a terminal buffer in 
normal mode. Like `diw` operates on a word (the `w` in `diw` (Delete Inner Word)). In this case,
the motion is `cm` (short for CoMmand). So, you can:

- `yicm`: Yank Inner CoMmand
- `2cm`: move to the next 2 CoMmands

...etc.

These mappings can be used like:
- `yicm`: Yank Inner CoMmand
- `vacm`: Visual select All of a CoMmand

        acm               A CoMmand (including the prompt)
        icm               Inner CoMmand (either only the prompt, or only the command output)

                                            *cm* 
`<count>cm`: Move forward by that many terminal commands
in a terminal buffer

                                            *CM* 
`<count>CM`: Move backward by that many terminal commands
in a terminal buffer

                                            *g:terminal_command_motion_prompt_matcher*
Put this in your vimrc. It acts as the `/` command that will be used to find your terminal
prompt, to differentiate each command from the next.
Example:
>
    let g:terminal_command_motion_prompt_matcher = "^john_doe in .* \%"
<

It uses standard vim regex, so you can use `\v` or \V` or `\c` or whatever.
